# Combustion--Analysis-of-the-unstable-acoustic-frequencies-of-a-Rijke-tube
This project investigates thermoacoustic instability phenomena using a simplified Rijke tube setup. The aim is to study how heat release and acoustic pressure waves interact to produce self-sustained oscillations. Numerical simulations were used to identify unstable modes and resonant frequencies that can lead to combustion-driven instabilities. This analysis is essential for designing stable combustors in propulsion systems.

# ðŸ”Š Analysis of the Unstable Acoustic Frequencies of a Rijke Tube

This project explores thermoacoustic instabilities in a Rijke tube â€” a canonical setup used to study the coupling between unsteady heat release and acoustic waves. Such instabilities are critical in combustion systems like gas turbines and rocket engines, where they can cause structural damage and loss of performance.

## Objectives
- Simulate the behavior of acoustic waves in a Rijke tube with heat addition.
- Identify unstable acoustic modes and dominant resonance frequencies.
- Investigate the conditions under which self-sustained oscillations occur.

## Key Concepts
- Thermoacoustic coupling
- Acoustic eigenmodes
- Linear stability analysis

## Tools Used
- OpenFOAM
- Python for post-processing
- FFT analysis for frequency detection

## Outcomes
- Identification of unstable frequency ranges
